<h3>
	Chapter - 1: Clean Code
</h3><hr>


* There will always be code!
* Bad code can bring down a successful app!
* Rushing to code usually ends up with bad code!
* Later means never. Instead of rushing to code, write clean code at the beginning!
* Without clean code, productivity decreases, and complexity of program increases over time!
* Write clean code even with a limited schedule. Defend the code! 
* Acquire "code-sense". Programmers with "code-sense" see options and alternatives when they encounter messy code. 
* "The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide.", **Bjarne Stroustrup**
* "Clean code does one thing well!",  **Bjarne Stroustrup**
* Bad code tries to do too much!
* "Clean code reads like well-written prose!", **Grady Booch**
* "Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests.", **Dave Thomas**
* "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.", **Michael Feathers**
